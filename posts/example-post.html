<h2>Real life examples</h2>
<img src="https://bpcdn.co/images/2016/05/grade4-moving-average-crossover2.png">
From around April to July, the pair was in a nice uptrend. It topped out at around 124.00, before slowly heading down. In the middle of July, we see that the 10 SMA crossed below the 20 SMA.<br>
And what happened next?<br>
A nice downtrend!<br>
f you had shorted at the crossover of the moving averages you would have made yourself almost a thousand pips!<br>
Of course, not every trade will be a thousand-pip winner, a hundred-pip winner, or even a 10-pip winner.<br>
